# "Proper-Lite" WordPress Theme

In June 2016, Briggo began work on replacing static marketing and
corporate information content with dynamic content served from a
dedicated EC2 WordPress node. At that time, dozens of free WordPress
themes were evaluated for appropriateness with the following
requirements:

* L&F that fits with the existing webapps.
* Highly customizable through GUI.
* Easily customizable and maintainable through code.
* Single-page presentation.
* Responsive.

After a 2-hour search, the "Proper-Lite" theme was deemed to most
adequately satisfy the above requirements, so it was installed.

There have been code changes required to bend the theme to our exact
purposes. Those changes are revision-controlled through this repository.
